The objective of this Standard is to specify Disclosure Requirements which will enable users newlineplaceholderof sustainability statements  to understand:  newlineplaceholder(a) how the undertaking affects climate change, in terms of material positive and negative newlineplaceholderactual and potential impacts;  newlineplaceholder(b) the undertaking’s past, current, and future mitigation efforts in line with the Paris newlineplaceholderAgreement (or an updated international agreement on climate change) and compatible newlineplaceholderwith limiting global warming to 1.5°C;  newlineplaceholder(c) the plans and capacity of the undertaking to adapt its strategy and business model, in newlineplaceholderline with the transition to a sustainable economy and to contribute to limiting global newlineplaceholderwarming to 1.5°C;  newlineplaceholder(d) any other actions  taken by the undertaking, and the result of such actions to prevent, newlineplaceholdermitigate or remediate actual or potential negative impacts, and to address risks  and newlineplaceholderopportunities ;  newlineplaceholder(e) the nature, type and extent of the undertaking’s material risks and opportunities ari sing newlineplaceholderfrom the undertaking’s impacts and dependencies  on climate change, and how the newlineplaceholderundertaking manages them; and  newlineplaceholder(f) the financial effects on the undertaking over the short -, medium - and long -term of risks newlineplaceholderand opportunities arising from the undertaking’s imp acts and dependencies on climate newlineplaceholderchange.  newlineplaceholder2. The Disclosure Requirements of this Standard take into account the requirements of related newlineplaceholderEU legislation and regulation (i.e., EU Climate Law1 , Climate eenchmark Standards newlineplaceholderRegulation2, Sustainable Finance Disclo sure Regulation (SFDR)3, EU Taxonomy33, and EeA newlineplaceholderPillar 3 disclosure requirements34).  newlineplaceholder3. This Standard covers Disclosure Requirements related to the following sustainability newlineplaceholdermatters:  “Climate change mitigation ” and “ Climate change adaptation ”. It also covers  newlineplaceholderenergy -related matters, to the extent that they are relevant to climate change.   newlineplaceholder4. Climate change mitigation  relates to the undertaking’s endeavours to the general process of newlineplaceholderlimiting the increase in the global average temperature to 1,5 °C above pre -indus trial levels in newlineplaceholderline with the Paris Agreement. This Standard covers disclosure requirements related but  newlineplaceholdernot limited to the seven Greenhouse gases (GHG) carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), newlineplaceholdernitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons ( PFCs), sulphur newlineplaceholderhexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). It also covers Disclosure Requirements on newlineplaceholderhow the undertaking addresses its GHG emissions as well as the associated transition risks .  newlineplaceholder5. Climate change adaptation  relates to the undertaking’s process of adjustment to actual and newlineplaceholderexpected climate change.  newlineplaceholder6. This Standard covers Disclosure Requirements regarding climate -related hazards that can newlineplaceholderlead to physical climate risks for the undertaking and its adaptation solutions to reduce these newlineplaceholder newlineplaceholder1 Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 June 2021 establishing the framework for newlineplaceholderachieving climate neutrality and amending Regulations (EC) No 401/2009 and (EU) 2018/1999 (‘European Climate Law’) (OJ L newlineplaceholder243, 9.7.2021, p. 1).   newlineplaceholder2  Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1818 of 17 July 2020 supplementing Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 of the newlineplaceholderEuropean Parliament and of the Council as regards minimum standards for EU Climate Transition eenchmarks and EU newlineplaceholderParisaligned eenchmarks (OJ L 406 , 3.12.2020, p. 17).   newlineplaceholder3 Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 on sustainability ‐related newlineplaceholderdisclosures in the financial services sector (Sustainable Finance Disclosures Regulation) (OJ L 317, 9.12.2019, p . 1).\n",

It also covers  transition risks arising from the needed adaptation to climate - related newlineplaceholderhazards.  newlineplaceholder7. The Disclosure Requirements related to “Energy” cover all types of energy production and newlineplaceholderconsumption.  newlineplaceholderInteractions with other ESRS  newlineplaceholder newlineplaceholder   newlineplaceholder8. Ozone -depleting substances  (ODS), nitrogen oxides (NOX) and sulphur oxides (SOX), newlineplaceholderamong other air emissions, are connected to climate change but are covered under the newlineplaceholderreporting requirements in ESRS E2.  newlineplaceholder9. Impacts on people that may arise from the transition to a climate -neutral economy are covered newlineplaceholderunder the ESRS S1 Own workforce, ESRS S2 Workers in the value chain, ESRS S3 Affected newlineplaceholdercommunities and ESRS S4 Consumers and end -users.  newlineplaceholder10. Climate change mitigation  and adaptation  are closely related to topics addresse d in newlineplaceholderparticular in ESRS E3 Water and marine resources  and ESRS E4 Biodiversity and newlineplaceholderecosystems . With regard to water and as illustrated in the table of climate -related hazards in newlineplaceholderAR 11, this standard addresses acute and chronic physical risks which arise fr om the water newlineplaceholderand ocean -related hazards. Biodiversity loss  and ecosystem degradation  that may be newlineplaceholdercaused by climate change are addressed in ESRS E4 Biodiversity and ecosystems .   newlineplaceholder11.

For the disclosure of the potential to pursue climate -related opportunities  required by paragraph 64 (c) newlineplaceholderthe undertaking shall consider16:  newlineplaceholder newlineplaceholder13  This information is aligned with Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1818 (Climate eenc hmark Regulation). 49 This disclosure newlineplaceholderrequirement is consistent with the requirements included in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/2453 - Template 5: eanking book newlineplaceholder- Climate change physical risk: Exposures subject to physical risk.  newlineplaceholder14 This discl osure requirement is consistent with the requirements included in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/2453 - Template newlineplaceholder5: eanking book - Climate change physical risk: Exposures subject to physical risk.  newlineplaceholder15 This disclosure requirement is consistent with the requirements included in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/2453 - Template newlineplaceholder2: eanking book - Climate change transition risk: Loans collateralised by immovable property - Energy efficiency of the collateral.  newlineplaceholder16 This information is aligned  with Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1818 (Climate eenchmark Regulation).  newlineplaceholder   newlineplaceholder14  newlineplaceholder  (a) its expected cost savings from climate change mitigation  and adaptation actions ; and  newlineplaceholder(b) the potential market size or expected changes to net revenue from low -carbon products and services newlineplaceholderor adaptation solutions to which the undertaking has or may have access.  newlineplaceholder70. A quantification of the financial effects that arise from opportunities  is not requ ired if such a disclosure newlineplaceholderdoes not meet the qualitative characteristics of useful information included under ESRS 1 Appendix e newlineplaceholderQualitative characteristics of information .  newlineplaceholder  newlineplaceholderAppendix A: Application Requirements   newlineplaceholderThis Appendix is an integral part of the ESR S E1. It supports the application of the disclosure newlineplaceholderrequirements set out in this standard and has the same authority as the other parts of the Standard.  newlineplaceholder  newlineplaceholderStrategy   newlineplaceholderDisclosure Requirement E1 -1 – Transition plan for climate change mitigation  newlineplaceholder newlineplaceholderAR 1.  A transition plan relates to the undertaking’s efforts in climate change mitigation . When newlineplaceholderdisclosing its transition plan, the undertaking is expected to provide a high -level explanation of newlineplaceholderhow it will adjust its strategy and business model to ensure  compatibility with the transition to newlineplaceholdera sustainable economy and with the limiting of global warming to 1.5°C in line with the Paris newlineplaceholderAgreement (or an updated inter   national agreement on climate change) and the objective of newlineplaceholderachieving climate neutrality by 2050 with no or limited overshoot as established in Regulation newlineplaceholder(EU) 2021/1119 (European Climate Law), and where applicable, how it will adjust its exposure newlineplaceholderto coal, and oil and gas -related activities.  newlineplaceholderAR 2.  Sectoral pathways have not yet been defined by  the public policies  for all sectors. Hence, the newlineplaceholderdisclosure under paragraph 16 (a) on the compatibility of the transition plan  with the objective newlineplaceholderof limiting global warming to 1.5°C should be understood as the disclosure of the undertaking’s newlineplaceholderGHG emissions reduction target . The disclosure under paragraph 16 (a) shall be newlineplaceholderbenchmarked in relation to a pathway to 1.5°C. This benchmark should be based on either a newlineplaceholdersectoral decarbonisation pathway if available for the undertaking’s sector or an economy -wide newlineplaceholderscenari o bearing in mind its limitations (i.e., it is a simple translation of emission reduction newlineplaceholderobjectives from the state to undertaking level). This AR should be read also in conjunction with newlineplaceholderAR 26 and AR 27 and the sectoral decarbonisation pathways they refer to.   newlineplaceholderAR 3.  When disclosing the information required under paragraph 16(d) the undertaking may newlineplaceholderconsider:  newlineplaceholder(a) the cumulative locked -in GHG  emissions associated with key assets from the newlineplaceholderreporting year until 2030 and 2050 in tCO 2eq. This will be assessed as the sum of the newlineplaceholderestimated Scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions over the operating lifetime of the active and newlineplaceholderfirmly planned key assets. Key assets are those owned or controlled by the newlineplaceholderundertaking, and they consist of existing or planned  assets (such as stationary or newlineplaceholdermobile installations,  facilities, and equipment) that are sources of either significant newlineplaceholderdirect or energy -indirect GHG emissions. Firmly planned key assets are those that the newlineplaceholderundertaking will most likely deploy within the next  5 years.  newlineplaceholder(b) the cumulative locked -in GHG emissions associated with the direct use -phase GHG newlineplaceholderemissions of sold products in tCO2eq, assessed as the sales volume of products in newlineplaceholderthe reporting year multiplied by the sum of estimated direct use -phase GHG emission s newlineplaceholderover their expected lifetime. This requirement only applies if the undertaking has newlineplaceholderidentified the Scope 3 category “use of sold products” as significant under Disclosure newlineplaceholderRequirement E1 -6 paragraph 51; and   newlineplaceholder(c) an explanation of the plans to manage, i.e., to  transform, decommission or phase out newlineplaceholderits GHG -intensive and energy -intensive assets and products.   newlineplaceholder15  newlineplaceholder  AR 4.  When disclosing the information required under paragraph 16 (e), the undertaking shall explain newlineplaceholderhow the alignment of its economic activities with the provisions of Commission Delegated newlineplaceholderRegulation (EU) 2021/2139 is expected to evolve over time to support its  transition to a newlineplaceholdersustainable economy. In doing so, the undertaking shall take account of the key performance newlineplaceholderindicators required to be disclosed under Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (in particular newlineplaceholdertaxonomy -aligned revenue and CapEx and, if applicabl e, CapEx plans).  newlineplaceholderAR 5.  When disclosing the information required under paragraph 16 (f), the undertaking shall state newlineplaceholderwhether or not it is excluded from the EU Paris -aligned eenchmarks in accordance with the newlineplaceholderexclusion criteria stated in Articles 12.1 (d) to (g)53 and 12.2 of Commission Delegated newlineplaceholderRegulation (EU) 2020/1818 (Climate eenchmark Standards Regulation)54.  newlineplaceholder  newlineplaceholderDisclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 SBM -3 - Material impacts, risks and newlineplaceholderopportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model  newlineplaceholder newlineplaceholderAR 6. When disclosing the information on the scope of the resilience analysis as required under newlineplaceholderparagraph 1 9 (a), the undertaking shall explain which part of its own operations and upstream newlineplaceholderand downstream value chain as well as which material physical  risks  and transition risks  newlineplaceholdermay have been excluded from the analysis.  newlineplaceholderAR 7. When disclosing the information on how the resilience analysis has been conducted as required newlineplaceholderunder paragraph 19 (b), the undertaking shall explain:  newlineplaceholder(a) the critical assumptions about how the transition to a lower -carbon and resilient economy will newlineplaceholderaffect its surrounding macroeconomic trends, e nergy consumption and mix, and technology newlineplaceholderdeployment assumptions;  newlineplaceholder(b) the time horizons applied and their alignment with the climate and business  newlineplaceholder                                                           newlineplaceholder53Article 12.1 of the Climate eenchmark Standards Regulation states that “ Administrators of EU Paris -aligned Benchmarks newlineplaceholdershall exclude the following companies:  newlineplaceholdera) companies that derive 1% or more of their revenues from exploration, mining, extraction, distribution or refining of hard newlineplaceholdercoal and lignite; or  newlineplaceholderb) companies that derive 10% or more of their revenues from exploration, extraction, distribution or refining of oi l fuels; or  newlineplaceholderc) companies that derive 50% or more of their revenues from exploration, extraction, manufacturing or distribution of gaseous newlineplaceholderfuels; or  newlineplaceholderd) companies that derive 50% or more of their revenues from electricity generation with a GHG intensity of more than 100 g newlineplaceholderCO2 e/KWh. ”  newlineplaceholderArticle 12.2 states that “ Administrators of EU Paris -aligned Benchmarks shall exclude from those benchmarks any companies newlineplaceholderthat are found or estimated by them or by external data providers to significantly harm one or more of the env ironmental newlineplaceholderobjectives referred to in Article 9 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council, in accordance newlineplaceholderwith the rules on estimations laid down in Article 13(2) of this Regulation .”.  newlineplaceholder54This disclosure requirement is consist ent with the requirements in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/2453 - newlineplaceholdertemplate 1 climate change transition risk.  newlineplaceholderscenarios  considered for determining material physical  and transition risks  (paragraphs AR newlineplaceholder11to AR 12) and setting GHG emissions re duction  targets  (reported under Disclosure newlineplaceholderRequirement E1 -4); and  newlineplaceholder(c)  how the estimated anticipated financial effects  from material physical  and transition risks  (as newlineplaceholderrequired by Disclosure Requirement E1 -9) as well as the mitigation actions  and resources newlineplaceholder(disclosed under Disclosure Requirement E1 -3) were considered.  newlineplaceholderAR 8. When disclosing the information on the results of the resilience analysis as required under newlineplaceholderparagraph 19 (c), the undertaking shall explain:  newlineplaceholder(a) the areas of uncertainties of the resilience  analysis and to what extent the assets and business newlineplaceholderactivities at risk are considered within the definition of the undertaking’s strategy, investment newlineplaceholderdecisions, and current and planned mitigation actions ;  newlineplaceholder  newlineplaceholder(b) the ability of the undertaking to adjust or adapt its strategy and business model  to climate newlineplaceholderchange over the short -, medium - and long -term, including securing ongoing access to finance  newlineplaceholder16  newlineplaceholder  at an affordable cost of capital, the ability to redeploy, upgrade or d ecommission existing assets, newlineplaceholdershifting its products and services portfolio, or reskilling its workforce.  newlineplaceholderImpact, risk and opportunity management   newlineplaceholder  newlineplaceholderDisclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 IRO -1 Description of the processes to identify newlineplaceholderand assess material climate -related impacts, risks and opportunities  newlineplaceholder newlineplaceholderAR 9. When disclosing the information on the processes to identify and assess climate impacts as newlineplaceholderrequired under paragraph 20 (a), the undertaking shall explain how it has:  newlineplaceholder(a) screened its activities and pla ns in order to identify actual and potential future GHG newlineplaceholderemission sources and, if applicable, drivers for other climate -related impacts (e.g., newlineplaceholderemissions of black carbon or tropospheric ozone or land-use change ) in own newlineplaceholderoperations and along the value chain; a nd  newlineplaceholder(b) assessed its actual and potential impacts on climate change (i.e., its total GHG newlineplaceholderemissions).  newlineplaceholderAR 10.

When disclosing the information on the processes to identify transition risks  and newlineplaceholderopportunities  as required under paragraph 20 (c), the undertaking shall explain whether and newlineplaceholderhow it has:  newlineplaceholder(a) identified transition events (see the table with examples below) over the short -, newlineplaceholdermedium - and long -term and screened whether its assets and business activities newlineplaceholdermay be exposed to these events. In case of transition risks and opportunities, what newlineplaceholderis considere d long -term may cover more than 10 years and may be aligned with newlineplaceholderclimate -related public policy  goals;  newlineplaceholder(b) assessed the extent to which its assets and business activities may be exposed newlineplaceholderand are sensitive to the identified transition events, taking into conside ration the newlineplaceholderlikelihood, magnitude and duration of the transition events;  newlineplaceholder(c) informed the identification of transition events and the assessment of exposure by newlineplaceholderclimate -related scenario analysis, considering at least a scenario consistent with newlineplaceholderthe Paris Agreeme nt and limiting climate change to 1.5°C, for example, based on newlineplaceholderscenarios of the International Energy Agency (Net zero Emissions by 2050, newlineplaceholderSustainable Development Scenario, etc), or NGFS (Network for Greening the newlineplaceholderFinancial System) climate scenarios. For the general requirements related to newlineplaceholderclimate -related scenario analysis see paragraphs 18, 19, AR 13 to AR 15; and  newlineplaceholder(d) identified assets and business activities that are incompatible with or need newlineplaceholdersignificant efforts to be compatible with a transition to a climate -neutral economy newlineplaceholder(for example, due to significant locked -in GHG  emissions or incompatibility with newlineplaceholderthe requirements for Taxonomy -alignment under Commission Delegated newlineplaceholderRegulation (EU) 2021/2139).  newlineplaceholder  newlineplaceholder   newlineplaceholder18  newlineplaceholder    newlineplaceholderExamples of climate -related transition events (examples based on TCFD classification)  newlineplaceholderPolicy and legal  Technology  Market  Reputation  newlineplaceholderIncreased pricing of GHG newlineplaceholderemissions  Substitution of existing newlineplaceholderproducts and services with newlineplaceholderlower emissions options  Changing customer newlineplaceholderbehaviour  Shifts in consumer newlineplaceholderpreferences  newlineplaceholderEnhanced emissions -newlineplaceholderreporting obligations  Unsuccessful investment in newlineplaceholdernew technologies  Uncertainty in market newlineplaceholdersignals  Stigmatization of sector  newlineplaceholderMandates on and newlineplaceholderregulation of existing newlineplaceholderproducts and services  Costs of transition to lower newlineplaceholderemissions technology  Increased cost of raw newlineplaceholdermaterials  Increased stakeholder newlineplaceholderconcern  newlineplaceholderMandates on and newlineplaceholderregulation of existing newlineplaceholderproduction processes    Negative stakeholder newlineplaceholderfeedback  newlineplaceholderExposure to litigation     newlineplaceholder newlineplaceholderClimate -related scenario analysis  newlineplaceholderAR 13. When disclosing the information required under paragraphs 19, 20, 21, AR 10 and AR 11, the newlineplaceholderundertaking shall explain how it has used climate -related scenario analysis  that is newlineplaceholdercommensurate to its circumstances to inform the identification and assessm ent of physical  newlineplaceholderand transition risks  and opportunities  over the short -, medium - and long -term, including:  newlineplaceholder(a) which scenarios  were used, their sources and alignment with state -of-the-art science;  newlineplaceholder(b) narratives, time horizons, and endpoints used with a discussio n of why it believes the newlineplaceholderrange of scenarios used covers its plausible risks and uncertainties;  newlineplaceholder(c) the key forces and drivers taken into consideration in each scenario and why these newlineplaceholderare relevant to the undertaking, for example, policy  assumptions, macroeconom ic newlineplaceholdertrends, energy usage and mix, and technology assumptions; and  newlineplaceholder(d) key inputs and constraints of the scenarios, including their level of detail (e.g., whether newlineplaceholderthe analysis of physical climate -related risks is based on geospatial coordinates newlineplaceholderspecific to the undertaking’s locations or national - or regional -level broad data).  newlineplaceholderAR 14. When conducting scenario analysis , the undertaking may consider the following guidance: newlineplaceholderTCFD Technical Supplement on “The Use of Scenario Analysis in Disclosure of Climate - newlineplaceholderRelated  Risks and Opportunities” (2017); TCFD “Guidance on Scenario Analysis for newlineplaceholderNonFinancial Companies” (2020); ISO 14091:2021 “Adaptation to climate change — newlineplaceholderGuidelines on vulnerability, impacts and risk assessment”; any other recognised industry newlineplaceholderstandards such  as NGFS (Network for Greening the Financial System); and EU, national, newlineplaceholderregional and local regulations.  newlineplaceholderAR 15. The undertaking shall briefly explain how the climate scenarios  used are compatible with the newlineplaceholdercritical climate -related assumptions made in the financial statements.  newlineplaceholder  newlineplaceholderDisclosure Requirement E1 -2 – Policies related to climate change mitigation and newlineplaceholderadaptation  newlineplaceholder  newlineplaceholderAR 16. Policies  related to either climate change mitigation  or climate adaptation  may be disclosed newlineplaceholderseparately as their objectives, people involved, actions  and resources needed to implement newlineplaceholderthem are different.  newlineplaceholder   newlineplaceholder19  newlineplaceholder  AR 17. Policies  related to climate change mitigation  address the management of the undertaki ng’s newlineplaceholderGHG emissions , GHG removals and transition risks  over different time horizons, in its own newlineplaceholderoperations and/or in the upstream and downstream value chain . The requirement under newlineplaceholderparagraph 14 may relate to stand -alone climate change mitigation policies as well as relevant newlineplaceholderpolicies on other matters that indirectly support climate change mitigation including training  newlineplaceholderpolicies, procurement or supply chain  policies, investment policies or product development newlineplaceholderpolicies.  newlineplaceholder  newlineplaceholderAR 18. Policies  related to climate chang e adaptation address the management of the undertaking’s newlineplaceholderphysical climate risks and of its transition risks  related to climate change adaptation. The requirement newlineplaceholderunder paragraphs 22 and 25 may relate to stand -alone climate change adaptation policies as wel l as newlineplaceholderrelevant policies on other matters that indirectly support climate change adaptation including training  newlineplaceholderpolicies, and emergency or health and safety policies.   newlineplaceholder newlineplaceholderDisclosure Requirements E1 -3 – Actions and resources in relation to climate change newlineplaceholderpolicie s  newlineplaceholder  newlineplaceholderAR 19. When disclosing the information on actions  as required under paragraphs 29 (a) and 29 (b), newlineplaceholderthe undertaking may:   newlineplaceholder(a) disclose its key actions taken and/or plans to implement climate change mitigation  newlineplaceholderand adaptation policies  in its single or separate actions;  newlineplaceholder(b) aggregate types of mitigation actions (decarbonisation levers) such as energy newlineplaceholderefficiency, electrification, fuel switching, use of renewable energy , products change, newlineplaceholderand supply -chain decarbonisation that fit the undertak ings' specific actions;  newlineplaceholder(c) disclose the list of key mitigation actions alongside the measurable targets  (as newlineplaceholderrequired by Disclosure Requirement E1 -4) with disaggregation by decarbonisation newlineplaceholderlevers; and  newlineplaceholder(d) disclose the climate change adaptation actions by type of  adaptation solution such newlineplaceholderas nature -based adaptation, engineering, or technological solutions.  newlineplaceholderAR 20. When disclosing the information on resources as required under paragraph 29 (c), the newlineplaceholderundertaking shall only disclose the significant OpEx and CapEx amoun ts required for the newlineplaceholderimplementation of the actions  as the purpose of this information is to demonstrate the newlineplaceholdercredibility of its actions rather than to reconcile the disclosed amounts to the financial newlineplaceholderstatements. The disclosed CapEx and OpEx amounts shall be the additions made to both newlineplaceholdertangible and intangible assets during the current financial year as well as the planned additions newlineplaceholderfor future periods of implementing the actions. The disclosed amounts shall only be the newlineplaceholderincremental financial investments directly contributing to the achievement of the undertaking’s newlineplaceholdertargets.  newlineplaceholderAR 21. In line with the requirements of ESRS 2 MDR -A, the undertaking shall explain if and to what newlineplaceholderextent its ability to implement the actions  depends on the availability and allocation of newlineplaceholderresources. Ongoing access to finance at an affordable cost of capital can be critical for the newlineplaceholderimplementation of the undertaking’s actions, which include its adjustments to supply/demand newlineplaceholderchanges or its related acquisitions and significant research and developme nt (R&D) newlineplaceholderinvestments.   newlineplaceholderAR 22. The amounts of OpEx and CapEx required for the implementation of the actions  disclosed newlineplaceholderunder paragraph 29 (c) shall be consistent with the key performance indicators (CapEx and newlineplaceholderOpEx  key performance indicators) and, if applicable, the CapEx plan required by Commission newlineplaceholderDelegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178. The undertaking shall explain any potential differences newlineplaceholderbetween the significant OpEx and CapEx amounts disclosed under this Standard  and the key newlineplaceholderperformance indicators disclosed under Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 newlineplaceholderdue to, for instance, the disclosure of non -eligible economic activities as defined in that newlineplaceholderdelegated regulation. The undertaking may structure its actions by economic activity to newlineplaceholdercompare its OpEx and CapEx, and if applicable its OpEx and/or   newlineplaceholder20  newlineplaceholder  CapEx plans to its Taxonomy -aligned key performance indicators.   newlineplaceholder  newlineplaceholderMetrics and targets   newlineplaceholder  newlineplaceholderDisclosure Requirement E1 -4 – Targets related to climate change mitigation and newlineplaceholderadaptation  newlineplaceholder newlineplaceholder  newlineplaceholderAR 23. Under paragraph 34 (a), the undertaking may disclose GHG emission reduction  targets in newlineplaceholderintensity value. Intensity targets are formulated as ratios of GHG emissions  relative to a unit newlineplaceholderof physical activity or economic output. Relevant units of activity or output   are referred to in newlineplaceholderESRS sector -specific standards. In cases where the undertaking has only set a GHG intensity newlineplaceholderreduction target, it shall nevertheless discl ose the associated absolute values for the target newlineplaceholderyear and interim target year(s). This may result in a situation where an undertaking is required newlineplaceholderto disclose an increase of absolute GHG emissions for the target year and interim target newlineplaceholderyear(s), for example  because it anticipates organic growth of its business.  newlineplaceholderAR 24. When disclosing the information required under paragraph 34 (b), the undertaking shall specify newlineplaceholderthe share of the target related to each respective GHG emission Scope (1, 2 or 3) . The newlineplaceholderundertakin g shall state the method used to calculate Scope 2 GHG emissions included in the newlineplaceholdertarget (i.e., either the location -based or market -based method). If the boundary of the GHG newlineplaceholderemission reduction target  diverges from that of the GHG emissions reported under newlineplaceholderDisclosure Requirement E1 -6, the undertaking shall disclose which gases are covered, the newlineplaceholderrespective percentage of Scope 1, 2, 3 and total GHG emissions covered by the target. For newlineplaceholderthe GHG emission reduction targets  of its subsidiaries, the undertaking shall a nalogously newlineplaceholderapply these requirements at the level of the subsidiary.  newlineplaceholderAR 25. When disclosing the information required under paragraph 34(c) on base year and baseline newlineplaceholdervalue:  newlineplaceholder(a) the undertaking shall briefly explain how it has ensured that the baseline value ag ainst newlineplaceholderwhich the progress towards the target is measured is representative in terms of the newlineplaceholderactivities covered and the influences from external factors (e.g., temperature newlineplaceholderanomalies in a certain year influencing the amount of energy consumption and related newlineplaceholderGHG emissions). This can be done by the normalisation of the baseline value, or, by newlineplaceholderusing a baseline value that is derived from a 3 -year average if this increases the newlineplaceholderrepresentativeness and allows a more faithful representation;  newlineplaceholder(b) the baseline value and base year shall not be changed unless significant changes in newlineplaceholdereither the target or reporting boundary occur. In such a case, the undertaking shall newlineplaceholderexplain how the new baseline value affects the new target, its achievement and newlineplaceholderpresentation of progress over time. To foster comparability, when setting new targets , newlineplaceholderthe undertaking shall select a recent base year that does not precede the first reporting newlineplaceholderyear of the new target period by longer than 3 years. For example, for 2030 as the newlineplaceholdertarget year and a target period between 2025 and 2030, the base year shall be newlineplaceholderselected from the period between 2022 and 2025;   newlineplaceholder(c) the undertaking shall update its base year from 2030 and after every 5 -year period newlineplaceholderthereafter. This means that before 2030, the base years chosen by undertakings ’ may newlineplaceholderbe either the currently applied base year for existing targets or the first year of newlineplaceholderapplication of the sustainability reporting requirements as set out in Article 5(2) of newlineplaceholderDirective (EU) 2022/2464 (2024, 2025 or 2026) and, after 2030, every 5 years (2 030, newlineplaceholder2035, etc); and  newlineplaceholder(d) when presenting climate -related targets, the undertaking may disclose the progress in newlineplaceholdermeeting these targets made before its current base year. In doing so, the undertaking newlineplaceholdershall, to the greatest extent possible, ensure that the inform ation on past progress is newlineplaceholderconsistent with the requirements of this Standard. In the case of methodological  newlineplaceholder21  newlineplaceholder  differences, for example, regarding target boundaries, the undertaking shall provide a newlineplaceholderbrief explanation for these differences.  newlineplaceholderAR 26. When disclosi ng the information required under paragraphs 34 (d) and 34 (e), the undertaking newlineplaceholdershall present the information over the target period with reference to a sector - specific, if newlineplaceholderavailable, or a cross -sector emission pathway compatible with limiting global warm ing to 1.5°C. newlineplaceholderFor this purpose, the undertaking shall calculate a 1.5°C aligned reference target value for newlineplaceholderScope 1 and 2 (and, if applicable, a separate one for Scope 3) against which its own GHG newlineplaceholderemission reduction targets  or interim targets in the respect ive Scopes can be compared.  newlineplaceholderAR 27. The reference target value may be calculated by multiplying the GHG emissions in the base newlineplaceholderyear with either a sector -specific (sectoral decarbonisation methodology) or cross -sector newlineplaceholder(contraction methodology) emission reduc tion factor. These emission reduction factors can newlineplaceholderbe derived from different sources. The undertaking should ensure that the source used is based newlineplaceholderon an emission reduction pathway compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5°C.   newlineplaceholderAR 28. The emission reduct ion factors are subject to further development. Consequently, newlineplaceholderundertakings are encouraged to only use updated publicly available information.  newlineplaceholder 2030\n",

The reference target value is dependent on the base year and baseline emissions of the newlineplaceholderundertaking’s GHG emission reduction target. As a result, the referen ce target value for newlineplaceholderundertakings with a recent base year or from higher baseline emissions may be less newlineplaceholderchallenging to achieve than it will be for undertakings that have already taken ambitious past newlineplaceholderactions  to reduce GHG emissions. Therefore, undertakings t hat have in the past achieved newlineplaceholderGHG emissions reductions compatible with either a 1.5°C -aligned cross -sector or sector  newlineplaceholderspecific pathway, may adjust their baseline emissions accordingly to determine the reference newlineplaceholdertarget value. Accordingly, if the undertaking i s adjusting the baseline emissions to determine newlineplaceholderthe reference target value, it shall not consider GHG emission reductions that precede the year newlineplaceholder2020 and it shall provide appropriate evidence of its past achieved GHG emission reduction.  newlineplaceholderAR 30. When disclos ing the information required under paragraph 34 (f), the undertaking shall explain:  newlineplaceholder(a) by reference to its climate change mitigation  actions , the decarbonisation levers newlineplaceholderand their estimated quantitative contributions to the achievement of its GHG emission newlineplaceholderreduction targets  broken down by each Scope (1, 2 and 3);  newlineplaceholder(b) whether it plans to adopt new technologies and the role of these to achieve its GHG newlineplaceholderemission reduction targets; and  newlineplaceholder(c) whether and how it has considered a diverse range of climate scenarios , at least newlineplaceholderincluding a climate scenario compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5°C, to detect newlineplaceholderrelevant environmental -, societal -, technology -, market - and policy -related newlineplaceholderdevelopments and determine its decarbonisation levers.  newlineplaceholderAR 31.

When preparing the information for reporting GHG emissions as required by paragraph 44, newlineplaceholderthe undertaking shall:  newlineplaceholder(a) consider the principles, requirements and guidance provided by the GHG Protocol newlineplaceholderCorporate Standard (version 2004). The undertaking ma y consider Commission newlineplaceholderRecommendation (EU) 2021/227958 or the requirements stipulated by EN ISO 14064 - newlineplaceholder1:2018. If the undertaking already applies the GHG accounting methodology of ISO  newlineplaceholder                                                           newlineplaceholder58 Commission Recommendation (EU) 2021/2279 of 15 December 2021 on the use of the Environmental Footprint methods to newlineplaceholdermeasure and communicate the life cycle environmental performance of products and  organisations (OJ L 471, 30.12.2021, p.  newlineplaceholder1).   newlineplaceholder14064 - 1: 2018, it shall nevertheless comply with the requirements of this standard (e.g., newlineplaceholderregarding reporting boundaries and the disclosure of market -based Scope 2 GHG newlineplaceholderemissions);  newlineplaceholder(b) disclose the methodologies , significant assumptions and emissions factors used to newlineplaceholdercalculate or measure GHG emissions accompanied by the reasons why they were newlineplaceholderchosen, and provide a reference or link to any calculation tools used;  newlineplaceholder(c) include emissions of CO 2, CH 4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF 6, and NF 3. Additional GHG may newlineplaceholderbe considered when significant; and  newlineplaceholder(d) use the most recent Global Warming Potential (GWP)  values published by the IPCC newlineplaceholderbased on a 100 -year time horizon to calculate CO2eq emissions of non -CO2 gases.  newlineplaceholderAR 40. When preparing the information for reporting GHG emissions from its associates, joint ventures, newlineplaceholderunconsolidated subsidiaries (investment en tities) and contractual arrangements as required by newlineplaceholderparagraph 50, the undertaking shall consolidate 100% of the GHG emissions of the entities it newlineplaceholderoperationally controls. In practice, this happens when the undertakings holds the license - or newlineplaceholderpermit - to oper ate the assets from these associates, joint ventures, unconsolidated newlineplaceholdersubsidiaries (investment entities) and contractual arrangements. When the undertaking has a newlineplaceholdercontractually defined part -time operational control, it shall consolidate 100% the GHG emitted newlineplaceholderduring the time of its operational control.   newlineplaceholderAR 41. In line with ESRS 1 chapter 3.7, the undertaking shall disaggregate information on its GHG newlineplaceholderemissions as appropriate. For example, the undertaking may disaggregate its Scope 1, 2, 3, newlineplaceholderor total GHG emission s by country, operating segments, economic activity, subsidiary, GHG newlineplaceholdercategory (CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3, and other GHG considered by the newlineplaceholderundertaking) or source type (stationary combustion, mobile combustion, process emissions newlineplaceholderand fugitive emissi ons).  newlineplaceholderAR 42. An undertaking might have a different reporting period from some or all of the entities in its newlineplaceholdervalue chain. In such circumstances, the undertaking is permitted to measure its GHG newlineplaceholderemissions in accordance with paragraph 44 using information for  reporting periods that are newlineplaceholderdifferent from its own reporting period if that information is obtained from entities in its value newlineplaceholderchain with reporting periods that are different from the undertaking’s reporting period, on the newlineplaceholdercondition that:   newlineplaceholder(a) the undertaking  uses the most recent data available from those entities in its value chain newlineplaceholderto measure and disclose its greenhouse gas emissions;  newlineplaceholder(b) the length of the reporting periods is the same; and  newlineplaceholder(c) the undertaking discloses the effects of significant events and changes  in circumstances newlineplaceholder(relevant to its GHG emissions) that occur between the reporting dates of the entities in newlineplaceholderits value chain and the date of the undertaking’s general purpose financial statements.  newlineplaceholderAR 43. When preparing the information on gross Scope 1 GHG  emissions required under paragraph newlineplaceholder48 (a), the undertaking shall:   newlineplaceholder27  newlineplaceholder  (a) calculate or measure GHG emissions from stationary combustion, mobile combustion, newlineplaceholderprocess emissions and fugitive emissions; and use suitable activity data that include the newlineplaceholdernon-renewable fue l consumption;  newlineplaceholder(b) use suitable and consistent emission factors;  newlineplaceholder(c) disclose biogenic emissions of CO 2 from the combustion or bio -degradation of biomass newlineplaceholderseparately from the Scope 1 GHG emissions, but include emissions of other types of newlineplaceholderGHG (in particular CH 4 and N 2O);   newlineplaceholder(d) not include any removals, or any purchased, sold or transferred carbon credits  or GHG newlineplaceholderallowances in the calculation of Scope 1 GHG emissions; and  newlineplaceholder(e) for activities reporting under the EU ETS, report on Scope 1 emissions following the EU newlineplaceholderETS methodology. The EU ETS methodology may also be applied to activities in newlineplaceholdergeographies and sectors that are not covered by the EU ETS.  newlineplaceholderAR 44. When preparing the info rmation on the percentage of Scope 1 GHG emissions from regulated newlineplaceholderemission trading schemes required under paragraph 48 (b), the undertaking shall:   newlineplaceholder(a) consider GHG emissions from the installations  it operates that are subject to regulated newlineplaceholderEmission Trading Sch emes (ETS), including the EU -ETS, national ETS and non -EU newlineplaceholderETS, if applicable;  newlineplaceholder(b) only include emissions of CO 2, CH 4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF 6, and NF 3;  newlineplaceholder(c) ensure the same accounting period for gross Scope 1 GHG emissions and GHG newlineplaceholderemissions regulated under the ETS; and  newlineplaceholder(d) calculate the share by using the following formula:  newlineplaceholder  newlineplaceholder                              GHG Emissions in (t CO 2eq) from EU ETS installations + national ETS installations + nonEU ETS installations                                                          newlineplaceholderScope 1 GHG emissions (t CO2eq)  newlineplaceholderAR 45. When preparing the information on gross Scope 2 GHG emissions required under paragraph newlineplaceholder49, the undertaking shall:  newlineplaceholder(a) consider the principles and requirements of th e GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance (version newlineplaceholder2015, in particular the Scope 2 quality criteria in chapter 7.1 relating to contractual newlineplaceholderinstruments); it may also consider Commission Recommendation (EU) 2021/2279 or the newlineplaceholderrelevant requirements for the quantification  of indirect GHG emissions from imported newlineplaceholderenergy in EN ISO 14064 -1:2018;  newlineplaceholder(b) include purchased or acquired electricity, steam, heat, and cooling consumed by the newlineplaceholderundertaking;  newlineplaceholder(c) avoid double counting of GHG emissions reported under Scope 1 or 3;  newlineplaceholder(d) apply the locati on-based and market -based methods to calculate Scope 2 GHG emissions newlineplaceholderand provide information on the share and types of contractual instruments. Location -newlineplaceholderbased method quantifies Scope 2 GHG emissions based on average energy newlineplaceholdergeneration emission factors for d efined locations, including local, subnational, or newlineplaceholdernational boundaries (GHG Protocol, “Scope 2 Guidance”, Glossary, 2015). newlineplaceholderMarket -based method quantifies Scope 2 GHG emissions based on GHG emissions newlineplaceholderemitted by the generators from which the reporting entity  contractually purchases newlineplaceholderelectricity bundled with instruments, or unbundled instruments on their own (GHG newlineplaceholderProtocol, “Scope 2 Guidance”, Glossary, 2015); in this case, the undertaking may disclose newlineplaceholderthe share of market -based scope 2 GHG emissions linked to pu rchased electricity newlineplaceholderbundled with instruments such as Guarantee of Origins or Renewable Energy Certificates. newlineplaceholderThe undertaking shall provide information about the share and types of contractual newlineplaceholderinstruments used for the sale and purchase of energy bundled with  attributes about the newlineplaceholderenergy generation or for unbundled energy attribute claims.   newlineplaceholder(e) disclose biogenic emissions of CO2 carbon from the combustion or biodegradation of newlineplaceholderbiomass separately from the Scope 2 GHG emissions but include emissions of other types newlineplaceholderof GHG (in particular CH4 and N2O). In case the emission factors applied do not separa te  newlineplaceholder28  newlineplaceholder  the percentage of biomass or biogenic CO2, the undertaking shall disclose this. In case newlineplaceholderGHG emissions other than CO2 (particularly CH4 and N2O) are not available for, or newlineplaceholderexcluded from, location -based grid average emissions factors or with the market -based newlineplaceholdermethod information, the undertaking shall disclose this.  newlineplaceholder(f) not include any removals, or any purchased, sold or transferred carbon credits  or GHG newlineplaceholderallowances in the calculation of Scope 2 GHG emissions.  newlineplaceholderAR 46. When preparing the information on gross Scope  3 GHG emissions required under paragraph newlineplaceholder51, the undertaking shall:  newlineplaceholder(a) consider the principles and provisions of the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain  newlineplaceholder(Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard (Version 2011); and it may consider newlineplaceholderCommission Recommendatio n (EU) 2021/2279 or the relevant requirements for the newlineplaceholderquantification of indirect GHG emissions from EN ISO 14064 -1:2018 ;  newlineplaceholder(b) if it is a financial institution, consider the GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the  newlineplaceholderFinancial Industry from the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financial (PCAF), newlineplaceholderspecifically part A “Financed Emissions” (version December 2022);  newlineplaceholder(c) screen its total Scope 3 GHG emissions based on the 15 Scope 3 categories identified newlineplaceholderby the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard and GHG Protocol Corporat e Value Chain newlineplaceholder(Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard (Version 2011) using appropriate newlineplaceholderestimates.

For the disclosure of the potential to pursue climate -related opportunities  required by paragraph 64 (c) newlineplaceholderthe undertaking shall consider16:  newlineplaceholder newlineplaceholder13  This information is aligned with Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1818 (Climate eenc hmark Regulation). 49 This disclosure newlineplaceholderrequirement is consistent with the requirements included in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/2453 - Template 5: eanking book newlineplaceholder- Climate change physical risk: Exposures subject to physical risk.  newlineplaceholder14 This discl osure requirement is consistent with the requirements included in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/2453 - Template newlineplaceholder5: eanking book - Climate change physical risk: Exposures subject to physical risk.  newlineplaceholder15 This disclosure requirement is consistent with the requirements included in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/2453 - Template newlineplaceholder2: eanking book - Climate change transition risk: Loans collateralised by immovable property - Energy efficiency of the collateral.  newlineplaceholder16 This information is aligned  with Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1818 (Climate eenchmark Regulation).  newlineplaceholder   newlineplaceholder14  newlineplaceholder  (a) its expected cost savings from climate change mitigation  and adaptation actions ; and  newlineplaceholder(b) the potential market size or expected changes to net revenue from low -carbon products and services newlineplaceholderor adaptation solutions to which the undertaking has or may have access.  newlineplaceholder70. A quantification of the financial effects that arise from opportunities  is not requ ired if such a disclosure newlineplaceholderdoes not meet the qualitative characteristics of useful information included under ESRS 1 Appendix e newlineplaceholderQualitative characteristics of information .  newlineplaceholder  newlineplaceholderAppendix A: Application Requirements   newlineplaceholderThis Appendix is an integral part of the ESR S E1. It supports the application of the disclosure newlineplaceholderrequirements set out in this standard and has the same authority as the other parts of the Standard.  newlineplaceholder  newlineplaceholderStrategy   newlineplaceholderDisclosure Requirement E1 -1 – Transition plan for climate change mitigation  newlineplaceholder newlineplaceholderAR 1.  A transition plan relates to the undertaking’s efforts in climate change mitigation . When newlineplaceholderdisclosing its transition plan, the undertaking is expected to provide a high -level explanation of newlineplaceholderhow it will adjust its strategy and business model to ensure  compatibility with the transition to newlineplaceholdera sustainable economy and with the limiting of global warming to 1.5°C in line with the Paris newlineplaceholderAgreement (or an updated inter   national agreement on climate change) and the objective of newlineplaceholderachieving climate neutrality by 2050 with no or limited overshoot as established in Regulation newlineplaceholder(EU) 2021/1119 (European Climate Law), and where applicable, how it will adjust its exposure newlineplaceholderto coal, and oil and gas -related activities.  newlineplaceholderAR 2.  Sectoral pathways have not yet been defined by  the public policies  for all sectors. Hence, the newlineplaceholderdisclosure under paragraph 16 (a) on the compatibility of the transition plan  with the objective newlineplaceholderof limiting global warming to 1.5°C should be understood as the disclosure of the undertaking’s newlineplaceholderGHG emissions reduction target . The disclosure under paragraph 16 (a) shall be newlineplaceholderbenchmarked in relation to a pathway to 1.5°C. This benchmark should be based on either a newlineplaceholdersectoral decarbonisation pathway if available for the undertaking’s sector or an economy -wide newlineplaceholderscenari o bearing in mind its limitations (i.e., it is a simple translation of emission reduction newlineplaceholderobjectives from the state to undertaking level). This AR should be read also in conjunction with newlineplaceholderAR 26 and AR 27 and the sectoral decarbonisation pathways they refer to.   newlineplaceholderAR 3.  When disclosing the information required under paragraph 16(d) the undertaking may newlineplaceholderconsider:  newlineplaceholder(a) the cumulative locked -in GHG  emissions associated with key assets from the newlineplaceholderreporting year until 2030 and 2050 in tCO 2eq. This will be assessed as the sum of the newlineplaceholderestimated Scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions over the operating lifetime of the active and newlineplaceholderfirmly planned key assets. Key assets are those owned or controlled by the newlineplaceholderundertaking, and they consist of existing or planned  assets (such as stationary or newlineplaceholdermobile installations,  facilities, and equipment) that are sources of either significant newlineplaceholderdirect or energy -indirect GHG emissions. Firmly planned key assets are those that the newlineplaceholderundertaking will most likely deploy within the next  5 years.  newlineplaceholder(b) the cumulative locked -in GHG emissions associated with the direct use -phase GHG newlineplaceholderemissions of sold products in tCO2eq, assessed as the sales volume of products in newlineplaceholderthe reporting year multiplied by the sum of estimated direct use -phase GHG emission s newlineplaceholderover their expected lifetime. This requirement only applies if the undertaking has newlineplaceholderidentified the Scope 3 category “use of sold products” as significant under Disclosure newlineplaceholderRequirement E1 -6 paragraph 51; and   newlineplaceholder(c) an explanation of the plans to manage, i.e., to  transform, decommission or phase out newlineplaceholderits GHG -intensive and energy -intensive assets and products.   newlineplaceholder15  newlineplaceholder  AR 4.  When disclosing the information required under paragraph 16 (e), the undertaking shall explain newlineplaceholderhow the alignment of its economic activities with the provisions of Commission Delegated newlineplaceholderRegulation (EU) 2021/2139 is expected to evolve over time to support its  transition to a newlineplaceholdersustainable economy. In doing so, the undertaking shall take account of the key performance newlineplaceholderindicators required to be disclosed under Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (in particular newlineplaceholdertaxonomy -aligned revenue and CapEx and, if applicabl e, CapEx plans).  newlineplaceholderAR 5.  When disclosing the information required under paragraph 16 (f), the undertaking shall state newlineplaceholderwhether or not it is excluded from the EU Paris -aligned eenchmarks in accordance with the newlineplaceholderexclusion criteria stated in Articles 12.1 (d) to (g)53 and 12.2 of Commission Delegated newlineplaceholderRegulation (EU) 2020/1818 (Climate eenchmark Standards Regulation)54.  newlineplaceholder  newlineplaceholderDisclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 SBM -3 - Material impacts, risks and newlineplaceholderopportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model  newlineplaceholder newlineplaceholderAR 6.

When disclosing the information on resources as required under paragraph 29 (c), the newlineplaceholderundertaking shall only disclose the significant OpEx and CapEx amoun ts required for the newlineplaceholderimplementation of the actions  as the purpose of this information is to demonstrate the newlineplaceholdercredibility of its actions rather than to reconcile the disclosed amounts to the financial newlineplaceholderstatements. The disclosed CapEx and OpEx amounts shall be the additions made to both newlineplaceholdertangible and intangible assets during the current financial year as well as the planned additions newlineplaceholderfor future periods of implementing the actions. The disclosed amounts shall only be the newlineplaceholderincremental financial investments directly contributing to the achievement of the undertaking’s newlineplaceholdertargets.  newlineplaceholderAR 21. In line with the requirements of ESRS 2 MDR -A, the undertaking shall explain if and to what newlineplaceholderextent its ability to implement the actions  depends on the availability and allocation of newlineplaceholderresources. Ongoing access to finance at an affordable cost of capital can be critical for the newlineplaceholderimplementation of the undertaking’s actions, which include its adjustments to supply/demand newlineplaceholderchanges or its related acquisitions and significant research and developme nt (R&D) newlineplaceholderinvestments.   newlineplaceholderAR 22. The amounts of OpEx and CapEx required for the implementation of the actions  disclosed newlineplaceholderunder paragraph 29 (c) shall be consistent with the key performance indicators (CapEx and newlineplaceholderOpEx  key performance indicators) and, if applicable, the CapEx plan required by Commission newlineplaceholderDelegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178. The undertaking shall explain any potential differences newlineplaceholderbetween the significant OpEx and CapEx amounts disclosed under this Standard  and the key newlineplaceholderperformance indicators disclosed under Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 newlineplaceholderdue to, for instance, the disclosure of non -eligible economic activities as defined in that newlineplaceholderdelegated regulation. The undertaking may structure its actions by economic activity to newlineplaceholdercompare its OpEx and CapEx, and if applicable its OpEx and/or   newlineplaceholder20  newlineplaceholder  CapEx plans to its Taxonomy -aligned key performance indicators.   newlineplaceholder  newlineplaceholderMetrics and targets   newlineplaceholder  newlineplaceholderDisclosure Requirement E1 -4 – Targets related to climate change mitigation and newlineplaceholderadaptation  newlineplaceholder newlineplaceholder  newlineplaceholderAR 23. Under paragraph 34 (a), the undertaking may disclose GHG emission reduction  targets in newlineplaceholderintensity value. Intensity targets are formulated as ratios of GHG emissions  relative to a unit newlineplaceholderof physical activity or economic output. Relevant units of activity or output   are referred to in newlineplaceholderESRS sector -specific standards. In cases where the undertaking has only set a GHG intensity newlineplaceholderreduction target, it shall nevertheless discl ose the associated absolute values for the target newlineplaceholderyear and interim target year(s). This may result in a situation where an undertaking is required newlineplaceholderto disclose an increase of absolute GHG emissions for the target year and interim target newlineplaceholderyear(s), for example  because it anticipates organic growth of its business.  newlineplaceholderAR 24. When disclosing the information required under paragraph 34 (b), the undertaking shall specify newlineplaceholderthe share of the target related to each respective GHG emission Scope (1, 2 or 3) . The newlineplaceholderundertakin g shall state the method used to calculate Scope 2 GHG emissions included in the newlineplaceholdertarget (i.e., either the location -based or market -based method). If the boundary of the GHG newlineplaceholderemission reduction target  diverges from that of the GHG emissions reported under newlineplaceholderDisclosure Requirement E1 -6, the undertaking shall disclose which gases are covered, the newlineplaceholderrespective percentage of Scope 1, 2, 3 and total GHG emissions covered by the target. For newlineplaceholderthe GHG emission reduction targets  of its subsidiaries, the undertaking shall a nalogously newlineplaceholderapply these requirements at the level of the subsidiary.  newlineplaceholderAR 25. When disclosing the information required under paragraph 34(c) on base year and baseline newlineplaceholdervalue:  newlineplaceholder(a) the undertaking shall briefly explain how it has ensured that the baseline value ag ainst newlineplaceholderwhich the progress towards the target is measured is representative in terms of the newlineplaceholderactivities covered and the influences from external factors (e.g., temperature newlineplaceholderanomalies in a certain year influencing the amount of energy consumption and related newlineplaceholderGHG emissions). This can be done by the normalisation of the baseline value, or, by newlineplaceholderusing a baseline value that is derived from a 3 -year average if this increases the newlineplaceholderrepresentativeness and allows a more faithful representation;  newlineplaceholder(b) the baseline value and base year shall not be changed unless significant changes in newlineplaceholdereither the target or reporting boundary occur. In such a case, the undertaking shall newlineplaceholderexplain how the new baseline value affects the new target, its achievement and newlineplaceholderpresentation of progress over time. To foster comparability, when setting new targets , newlineplaceholderthe undertaking shall select a recent base year that does not precede the first reporting newlineplaceholderyear of the new target period by longer than 3 years. For example, for 2030 as the newlineplaceholdertarget year and a target period between 2025 and 2030, the base year shall be newlineplaceholderselected from the period between 2022 and 2025;   newlineplaceholder(c) the undertaking shall update its base year from 2030 and after every 5 -year period newlineplaceholderthereafter. This means that before 2030, the base years chosen by undertakings ’ may newlineplaceholderbe either the currently applied base year for existing targets or the first year of newlineplaceholderapplication of the sustainability reporting requirements as set out in Article 5(2) of newlineplaceholderDirective (EU) 2022/2464 (2024, 2025 or 2026) and, after 2030, every 5 years (2 030, newlineplaceholder2035, etc); and  newlineplaceholder(d) when presenting climate -related targets, the undertaking may disclose the progress in newlineplaceholdermeeting these targets made before its current base year. In doing so, the undertaking newlineplaceholdershall, to the greatest extent possible, ensure that the inform ation on past progress is newlineplaceholderconsistent with the requirements of this Standard. In the case of methodological  newlineplaceholder21  newlineplaceholder  differences, for example, regarding target boundaries, the undertaking shall provide a newlineplaceholderbrief explanation for these differences.  newlineplaceholderAR 26. When disclosi ng the information required under paragraphs 34 (d) and 34 (e), the undertaking newlineplaceholdershall present the information over the target period with reference to a sector - specific, if newlineplaceholderavailable, or a cross -sector emission pathway compatible with limiting global warm ing to 1.5°C. newlineplaceholderFor this purpose, the undertaking shall calculate a 1.5°C aligned reference target value for newlineplaceholderScope 1 and 2 (and, if applicable, a separate one for Scope 3) against which its own GHG newlineplaceholderemission reduction targets  or interim targets in the respect ive Scopes can be compared.  newlineplaceholderAR 27. The reference target value may be calculated by multiplying the GHG emissions in the base newlineplaceholderyear with either a sector -specific (sectoral decarbonisation methodology) or cross -sector newlineplaceholder(contraction methodology) emission reduc tion factor. These emission reduction factors can newlineplaceholderbe derived from different sources. The undertaking should ensure that the source used is based newlineplaceholderon an emission reduction pathway compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5°C.   newlineplaceholderAR 28. The emission reduct ion factors are subject to further development. Consequently, newlineplaceholderundertakings are encouraged to only use updated publicly available information.  newlineplaceholder 2030  2050  newlineplaceholderCross -sector (ACA)  reductions newlineplaceholderpathway based on  the year newlineplaceholder2020 as the reference year  -42% -90% newlineplaceholder newlineplaceholderSource: based on Pathways to Net -zero –SBTi Technical Summary (Version 1.0, October 2021)  newlineplaceholder  newlineplaceholderAR 29. The reference target value is dependent on the base year and baseline emissions of the newlineplaceholderundertaking’s GHG emission reduction target. As a result, the referen ce target value for newlineplaceholderundertakings with a recent base year or from higher baseline emissions may be less newlineplaceholderchallenging to achieve than it will be for undertakings that have already taken ambitious past newlineplaceholderactions  to reduce GHG emissions. Therefore, undertakings t hat have in the past achieved newlineplaceholderGHG emissions reductions compatible with either a 1.5°C -aligned cross -sector or sector  newlineplaceholderspecific pathway, may adjust their baseline emissions accordingly to determine the reference newlineplaceholdertarget value. Accordingly, if the undertaking i s adjusting the baseline emissions to determine newlineplaceholderthe reference target value, it shall not consider GHG emission reductions that precede the year newlineplaceholder2020 and it shall provide appropriate evidence of its past achieved GHG emission reduction.  newlineplaceholderAR 30. When disclos ing the information required under paragraph 34 (f), the undertaking shall explain:  newlineplaceholder(a) by reference to its climate change mitigation  actions , the decarbonisation levers newlineplaceholderand their estimated quantitative contributions to the achievement of its GHG emission newlineplaceholderreduction targets  broken down by each Scope (1, 2 and 3);  newlineplaceholder(b) whether it plans to adopt new technologies and the role of these to achieve its GHG newlineplaceholderemission reduction targets; and  newlineplaceholder(c) whether and how it has considered a diverse range of climate scenarios , at least newlineplaceholderincluding a climate scenario compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5°C, to detect newlineplaceholderrelevant environmental -, societal -, technology -, market - and policy -related newlineplaceholderdevelopments and determine its decarbonisation levers.  newlineplaceholderAR 31. The undertaking may present it s GHG emission reduction targets  together with its climate newlineplaceholderchange mitigation  actions  (see paragraph AR 19) as a table or graphical pathway showing newlineplaceholderdevelopments over time. The following figure and table provide examples combining targets newlineplaceholderand decarbonisation  levers:  newlineplaceholder  newlineplaceholder  newlineplaceholder   newlineplaceholder22  newlineplaceholder   newlineplaceholder  Base year newlineplaceholder(e.g., 2025)  2030   target  2035   target  … Up to 2050  newlineplaceholdertarget  newlineplaceholderGHG emissions ( ktCO 2eq) 100 60 40   newlineplaceholderEnergy efficiency and newlineplaceholderconsumption reduction  - -10 -4   newlineplaceholderMaterial efficiency and newlineplaceholderconsumption reduction  - -5 -   newlineplaceholderFuel switching  - -2 -   newlineplaceholderElectrification  - - -10   newlineplaceholderUse of renewable energy  - -10 -3   newlineplaceholderPhase out or substitution  of newlineplaceholderproduct change  - -8 -   newlineplaceholderPhase out or substitution  of newlineplaceholderprocess change  - -5 -3   newlineplaceholderOther  - -    newlineplaceholder  newlineplaceholder  newlineplaceholder newlineplaceholder23  newlineplaceholder   newlineplaceholderDisclosure Requirement E1 -5 – Energy consumption and mix  newlineplaceholder  newlineplaceholderCalculation guidance  newlineplaceholderAR 32. When preparing the information on energy consumption required under paragraph 35, the newlineplaceholderundertaking shall:  newlineplaceholder(a) only report energy consumed from processes owned or controlled by the undertaking newlineplaceholderapplying the same perimeter applied for reporting GHG Scopes 1 and 2 emissions;  newlineplaceholder(b) exclude feedstocks and fuels that are not combusted for energy purposes. The newlineplaceholderundertaking that  consumes fuel as feedstocks can disclose information on this newlineplaceholderconsumption separately from the required disclosures;  newlineplaceholder(c) ensure all quantitative energy -related information is reported in either Mega -Watt- newlineplaceholderhours (MWh) in Lower Heating Value or net calorific val ue. If raw data of energy - newlineplaceholderrelated information is only available in energy units other than MWh (such as newlineplaceholderGigaJoules (GJ) or eritish Thermal Units (etu)), in volume units (such as cubic feet or newlineplaceholdergallons) or in mass units (such as kilograms or pounds), they s hall be converted to newlineplaceholderMWh using suitable conversion factors (see for example Annex II of the Fifth newlineplaceholderAssessment IPCC report). Conversion factors for fuels shall be made transparent and newlineplaceholderapplied in a consistent manner;  newlineplaceholder(d) ensure all quantitative energy -related in formation is reported as final energy newlineplaceholderconsumption, referring to the amount of energy the undertaking actually consumes newlineplaceholderusing for example the table in Annex IV of Directive 2012/27 of the European newlineplaceholderParliament and of the Council17 on energy efficiency;  newlineplaceholder(e) avoid  double counting fuel consumption when disclosing self -generated energy newlineplaceholderconsumption. If the undertaking generates electricity from either a non -renewable or newlineplaceholderrenewable fuel source and then consumes the generated electricity, the energy newlineplaceholderconsumption shall be counted only once under fuel consumption;  newlineplaceholder(f) not offset energy consumption even if on site generated energy is sold to and used by newlineplaceholdera third party;  newlineplaceholder(g) not count energy that is sourced from within the organisational boundary under newlineplaceholder“purchased or acquired” energy;  newlineplaceholder(h) account for steam, heat or cooling received as “waste energy” from a third party’s newlineplaceholderindustrial processes under “purchased or acquired” energy;  newlineplaceholder(i) account for renewable hydrogen56 as a renewable fuel. Hydrogen that is not newlineplaceholdercompletely derived from renewable sour ces shall be included under “fuel consumption newlineplaceholderfrom other non -renewable sources”; and  newlineplaceholder(j) adopt a conservative approach when splitting the electricity, steam, heat or cooling newlineplaceholderbetween renewable and non -renewable sources based on the approach applied to newlineplaceholdercalculat e market -based Scope 2 GHG emissions. The undertaking shall only consider newlineplaceholderthese energy consumptions as deriving from renewable sources if the origin of the newlineplaceholderpurchased energy is clearly defined in the contractual arrangements with its suppliers newlineplaceholder(renewable po wer purchasing agreement, standardised green electricity tariff, market newlineplaceholder newlineplaceholder17 Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on energy efficiency, amending newlineplaceholderDirectives 2009/125/EC and 2010/30/EU and repeali ng Directives 2004/8/EC and 2006/32/EC (OJ L 315, 14.11.2012, p. 1).  56 newlineplaceholderCompliant with the requirements in delegated acts for hydrogen from renewable sources: Commission delegated regulation of newlineplaceholder10 February 2023 supplementing Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of th e European Parliament and of the Council by establishing a newlineplaceholderUnion methodology setting out detailed rules for the production of renewable liquid and gaseous transport fuels of nonbiologi cal newlineplaceholderorigin; and Commission delegated regulation of 10 February 2023 supp lementing Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of the European newlineplaceholderParliament and of the Council by establishing a minimum threshold for greenhouse gas emissions savings of recycled carbon newlineplaceholderfuels and by specifying a methodology for assessing greenhouse gas emissions saving s from renewable liquid and gaseous newlineplaceholdertransport fuels of non -biological origin and from recycled carbon fuel.    newlineplaceholder24  newlineplaceholder  instruments like Guarantee of Origin from renewable sources in Europe18 or similar newlineplaceholderinstruments like Renewable Energy Certificates in the US and Canada, etc.).  newlineplaceholderAR 33. The information r equired under paragraph 37 (a) is applicable if the undertaking is operating in newlineplaceholderat least one high climate impact sector . The information required under paragraph 38 (a) to newlineplaceholder(e). shall also include energy from fossil sources consumed in operations that are n ot in high newlineplaceholderclimate impact sectors.  newlineplaceholderAR 34.

When preparing the information for reporting GHG emissions as required by paragraph 44, newlineplaceholderthe undertaking shall:  newlineplaceholder(a) consider the principles, requirements and guidance provided by the GHG Protocol newlineplaceholderCorporate Standard (version 2004). The undertaking ma y consider Commission newlineplaceholderRecommendation (EU) 2021/227958 or the requirements stipulated by EN ISO 14064 - newlineplaceholder1:2018. If the undertaking already applies the GHG accounting methodology of ISO  newlineplaceholder                                                           newlineplaceholder58 Commission Recommendation (EU) 2021/2279 of 15 December 2021 on the use of the Environmental Footprint methods to newlineplaceholdermeasure and communicate the life cycle environmental performance of products and  organisations (OJ L 471, 30.12.2021, p.  newlineplaceholder1).   newlineplaceholder14064 - 1: 2018, it shall nevertheless comply with the requirements of this standard (e.g., newlineplaceholderregarding reporting boundaries and the disclosure of market -based Scope 2 GHG newlineplaceholderemissions);  newlineplaceholder(b) disclose the methodologies , significant assumptions and emissions factors used to newlineplaceholdercalculate or measure GHG emissions accompanied by the reasons why they were newlineplaceholderchosen, and provide a reference or link to any calculation tools used;  newlineplaceholder(c) include emissions of CO 2, CH 4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF 6, and NF 3. Additional GHG may newlineplaceholderbe considered when significant; and  newlineplaceholder(d) use the most recent Global Warming Potential (GWP)  values published by the IPCC newlineplaceholderbased on a 100 -year time horizon to calculate CO2eq emissions of non -CO2 gases.  newlineplaceholderAR 40. When preparing the information for reporting GHG emissions from its associates, joint ventures, newlineplaceholderunconsolidated subsidiaries (investment en tities) and contractual arrangements as required by newlineplaceholderparagraph 50, the undertaking shall consolidate 100% of the GHG emissions of the entities it newlineplaceholderoperationally controls. In practice, this happens when the undertakings holds the license - or newlineplaceholderpermit - to oper ate the assets from these associates, joint ventures, unconsolidated newlineplaceholdersubsidiaries (investment entities) and contractual arrangements. When the undertaking has a newlineplaceholdercontractually defined part -time operational control, it shall consolidate 100% the GHG emitted newlineplaceholderduring the time of its operational control.   newlineplaceholderAR 41. In line with ESRS 1 chapter 3.7, the undertaking shall disaggregate information on its GHG newlineplaceholderemissions as appropriate. For example, the undertaking may disaggregate its Scope 1, 2, 3, newlineplaceholderor total GHG emission s by country, operating segments, economic activity, subsidiary, GHG newlineplaceholdercategory (CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3, and other GHG considered by the newlineplaceholderundertaking) or source type (stationary combustion, mobile combustion, process emissions newlineplaceholderand fugitive emissi ons).  newlineplaceholderAR 42. An undertaking might have a different reporting period from some or all of the entities in its newlineplaceholdervalue chain. In such circumstances, the undertaking is permitted to measure its GHG newlineplaceholderemissions in accordance with paragraph 44 using information for  reporting periods that are newlineplaceholderdifferent from its own reporting period if that information is obtained from entities in its value newlineplaceholderchain with reporting periods that are different from the undertaking’s reporting period, on the newlineplaceholdercondition that:   newlineplaceholder(a) the undertaking  uses the most recent data available from those entities in its value chain newlineplaceholderto measure and disclose its greenhouse gas emissions;  newlineplaceholder(b) the length of the reporting periods is the same; and  newlineplaceholder(c) the undertaking discloses the effects of significant events and changes  in circumstances newlineplaceholder(relevant to its GHG emissions) that occur between the reporting dates of the entities in newlineplaceholderits value chain and the date of the undertaking’s general purpose financial statements.  newlineplaceholderAR 43. When preparing the information on gross Scope 1 GHG  emissions required under paragraph newlineplaceholder48 (a), the undertaking shall:   newlineplaceholder27  newlineplaceholder  (a) calculate or measure GHG emissions from stationary combustion, mobile combustion, newlineplaceholderprocess emissions and fugitive emissions; and use suitable activity data that include the newlineplaceholdernon-renewable fue l consumption;  newlineplaceholder(b) use suitable and consistent emission factors;  newlineplaceholder(c) disclose biogenic emissions of CO 2 from the combustion or bio -degradation of biomass newlineplaceholderseparately from the Scope 1 GHG emissions, but include emissions of other types of newlineplaceholderGHG (in particular CH 4 and N 2O);   newlineplaceholder(d) not include any removals, or any purchased, sold or transferred carbon credits  or GHG newlineplaceholderallowances in the calculation of Scope 1 GHG emissions; and  newlineplaceholder(e) for activities reporting under the EU ETS, report on Scope 1 emissions following the EU newlineplaceholderETS methodology. The EU ETS methodology may also be applied to activities in newlineplaceholdergeographies and sectors that are not covered by the EU ETS.  newlineplaceholderAR 44. When preparing the info rmation on the percentage of Scope 1 GHG emissions from regulated newlineplaceholderemission trading schemes required under paragraph 48 (b), the undertaking shall:   newlineplaceholder(a) consider GHG emissions from the installations  it operates that are subject to regulated newlineplaceholderEmission Trading Sch emes (ETS), including the EU -ETS, national ETS and non -EU newlineplaceholderETS, if applicable;  newlineplaceholder(b) only include emissions of CO 2, CH 4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF 6, and NF 3;  newlineplaceholder(c) ensure the same accounting period for gross Scope 1 GHG emissions and GHG newlineplaceholderemissions regulated under the ETS; and  newlineplaceholder(d) calculate the share by using the following formula:  newlineplaceholder  newlineplaceholder                              GHG Emissions in (t CO 2eq) from EU ETS installations + national ETS installations + nonEU ETS installations                                                          newlineplaceholderScope 1 GHG emissions (t CO2eq)  newlineplaceholderAR 45. When preparing the information on gross Scope 2 GHG emissions required under paragraph newlineplaceholder49, the undertaking shall:  newlineplaceholder(a) consider the principles and requirements of th e GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance (version newlineplaceholder2015, in particular the Scope 2 quality criteria in chapter 7.1 relating to contractual newlineplaceholderinstruments); it may also consider Commission Recommendation (EU) 2021/2279 or the newlineplaceholderrelevant requirements for the quantification  of indirect GHG emissions from imported newlineplaceholderenergy in EN ISO 14064 -1:2018;  newlineplaceholder(b) include purchased or acquired electricity, steam, heat, and cooling consumed by the newlineplaceholderundertaking;  newlineplaceholder(c) avoid double counting of GHG emissions reported under Scope 1 or 3;  newlineplaceholder(d) apply the locati on-based and market -based methods to calculate Scope 2 GHG emissions newlineplaceholderand provide information on the share and types of contractual instruments. Location -newlineplaceholderbased method quantifies Scope 2 GHG emissions based on average energy newlineplaceholdergeneration emission factors for d efined locations, including local, subnational, or newlineplaceholdernational boundaries (GHG Protocol, “Scope 2 Guidance”, Glossary, 2015). newlineplaceholderMarket -based method quantifies Scope 2 GHG emissions based on GHG emissions newlineplaceholderemitted by the generators from which the reporting entity  contractually purchases newlineplaceholderelectricity bundled with instruments, or unbundled instruments on their own (GHG newlineplaceholderProtocol, “Scope 2 Guidance”, Glossary, 2015); in this case, the undertaking may disclose newlineplaceholderthe share of market -based scope 2 GHG emissions linked to pu rchased electricity newlineplaceholderbundled with instruments such as Guarantee of Origins or Renewable Energy Certificates. newlineplaceholderThe undertaking shall provide information about the share and types of contractual newlineplaceholderinstruments used for the sale and purchase of energy bundled with  attributes about the newlineplaceholderenergy generation or for unbundled energy attribute claims.   newlineplaceholder(e) disclose biogenic emissions of CO2 carbon from the combustion or biodegradation of newlineplaceholderbiomass separately from the Scope 2 GHG emissions but include emissions of other types newlineplaceholderof GHG (in particular CH4 and N2O). In case the emission factors applied do not separa te  newlineplaceholder28  newlineplaceholder  the percentage of biomass or biogenic CO2, the undertaking shall disclose this. In case newlineplaceholderGHG emissions other than CO2 (particularly CH4 and N2O) are not available for, or newlineplaceholderexcluded from, location -based grid average emissions factors or with the market -based newlineplaceholdermethod information, the undertaking shall disclose this.  newlineplaceholder(f) not include any removals, or any purchased, sold or transferred carbon credits  or GHG newlineplaceholderallowances in the calculation of Scope 2 GHG emissions.  newlineplaceholderAR 46. When preparing the information on gross Scope  3 GHG emissions required under paragraph newlineplaceholder51, the undertaking shall:  newlineplaceholder(a) consider the principles and provisions of the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain  newlineplaceholder(Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard (Version 2011); and it may consider newlineplaceholderCommission Recommendatio n (EU) 2021/2279 or the relevant requirements for the newlineplaceholderquantification of indirect GHG emissions from EN ISO 14064 -1:2018 ;  newlineplaceholder(b) if it is a financial institution, consider the GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the  newlineplaceholderFinancial Industry from the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financial (PCAF), newlineplaceholderspecifically part A “Financed Emissions” (version December 2022);  newlineplaceholder(c) screen its total Scope 3 GHG emissions based on the 15 Scope 3 categories identified newlineplaceholderby the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard and GHG Protocol Corporat e Value Chain newlineplaceholder(Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard (Version 2011) using appropriate newlineplaceholderestimates.

In addition to their GHG emission inventories, undertakings shall provide transparency on how newlineplaceholderand to what extent they either enhance natural sinks or apply techn ical solutions to remove newlineplaceholderGHGs from the atmosphere in their own operations and upstream and downstream value newlineplaceholderchain. While there are no generally accepted concepts and methodologies for accounting for newlineplaceholderGHG removals, this Standard aims to increase transparency  on the undertaking’s efforts to newlineplaceholderremove GHGs from the atmosphere (paragraphs 56 (a) and 58). The GHG removals outside newlineplaceholderthe value chain that the undertaking supports through the purchase of carbon credits  are to newlineplaceholderbe disclosed separately as required by paragra phs 56 (b) and 59.  newlineplaceholderAR 57. When disclosing the information on GHG removals and storage  from the undertaking’s own newlineplaceholderoperations and its upstream and downstream  value chain required under paragraphs 56 (a) newlineplaceholderand 58, for each removal and storage activity, the und ertaking shall describe:  newlineplaceholder(a) the GHGs concerned;  newlineplaceholder(b) whether removal and storage are biogenic or from land-use change  (e.g., afforestation, newlineplaceholderreforestation, forest restoration, urban tree planting, agroforestry, building soil carbon, newlineplaceholderetc.), technological (e.g., di rect air capture), or hybrid (e.g., bioenergy with CO 2 capture newlineplaceholderand storage), and technological details about the removal, the type of storage and, if newlineplaceholderapplicable, the transport of removed GHGs;  newlineplaceholder(c) if applicable, a brief explanation of whether the activity qua lifies as a nature -based newlineplaceholdersolution; and  newlineplaceholder(d) how the risk of non -permanence is managed, including determining and monitoring newlineplaceholderleakage and reversal events, as appropriate.  newlineplaceholderCalculation guidance   newlineplaceholderAR 58. When preparing the information on GHG removals and storage  from the undertaking’s own newlineplaceholderoperations and its upstream and downstream  value chain required under paragraphs 56 (a) and 58, newlineplaceholderthe undertaking shall:  newlineplaceholder(a) consider, as far as applicable, the GHG Pro tocol Corporate Standard (version 2004), newlineplaceholderProduct Standard (version 2011), Agriculture Guidance (version 2014), Land use, land-newlineplaceholderuse change , and forestry Guidance for GHG project accounting (version 2006);  newlineplaceholder  newlineplaceholder(b) apply consensus methods on accounting for GHG remo vals as soon as they are newlineplaceholderavailable, notably the EU regulatory framework for the certification of CO2 removals;  newlineplaceholder(c) if applicable, explain the role of removals for its climate change mitigation  policy ;  newlineplaceholder(d) include removals from operations that it owns, controls , or contributes to and that have newlineplaceholdernot been sold to another party through carbon credits;  newlineplaceholder(e) if applicable, mark those GHG removal activities in own operations or the value chain newlineplaceholderthat have been converted into carbon credits and sold on to other partie s on the newlineplaceholdervoluntary market;   newlineplaceholder33  newlineplaceholder  (f) account for the GHG emissions associated with a removal activity, including transport newlineplaceholderand storage, under Disclosure Requirement E1 -6 (Scopes 1, 2 or 3). To increase newlineplaceholdertransparency on the efficiency of a removal activity, including  transport and storage, the newlineplaceholderundertaking may disclose the GHG emissions associated with this activity (e.g., GHG newlineplaceholderemissions from electricity consumption of direct air capture technologies) alongside, but newlineplaceholderseparately from, the amount of removed GHG emissions;  newlineplaceholder(g) in case of a reversal, account for the respective GHG emissions as an offset for the newlineplaceholderremovals in the reporting period;  newlineplaceholder(h) use the most recent GWP  values published by the IPCC based on a 100 -year time newlineplaceholderhorizon to calculate CO 2eq emissions of non -CO 2 gases and  describe the assumptions newlineplaceholdermade, methodologies and frameworks applied for calculation of the amount of GHG newlineplaceholderremovals; and  newlineplaceholder(i) consider nature -based solutions.  newlineplaceholderAR 59. The undertaking shall disaggregate and separately disclose the GHG removals that occur in its newlineplaceholderown operations and those that occur in its upstream and downstream value chain. GHG newlineplaceholderremoval activities in the upstream and downstream value chain shall include those that the newlineplaceholderundertaking is actively supporting, for example, through a cooperation project wi th a supplier . newlineplaceholderThe undertaking is not expected to include any GHG removals that may occur in its upstream newlineplaceholderand downstream value chain that it is not aware of.  newlineplaceholderAR 60.

Financing GHG emission reduction projects outside the undertaking’s value chain through newlineplaceholderpurchasing carbon credits  that fulfil high -quality standards can be a useful contribution newlineplaceholdertowards mitiga ting climate change. This Standard requires the undertaking to disclose whether newlineplaceholderit uses carbon credits  separately from the GHG emissions (paragraphs 56 (b) and 59) and newlineplaceholderGHG emission reduction targets  (Disclosure Requirement E1 -4). It also requires the newlineplaceholderunder taking to show the extent of use and which quality criteria it uses for those carbon credits.  newlineplaceholderAR 62. When disclosing the information on carbon credits  required under paragraphs 56 (b)  and 59, newlineplaceholderthe undertaking shall disclose the following disaggregation as applicable:  newlineplaceholder(a) the share (percentage of volume) of reduction projects and removal projects;  newlineplaceholder(b) for carbon credits from removal projects, an explanation wh ether they are from biogenic newlineplaceholderor technological sinks;   newlineplaceholder(c) the share (percentage of volume) for each recognised quality standard;  newlineplaceholder(d) the share (percentage of volume) issued from projects in the EU; and  newlineplaceholder(e) the share (percentage of volume) that qualifies as a corresponding adjustment under newlineplaceholderArticle. 6 of the Paris Agreement.  newlineplaceholderCalculation guidance  newlineplaceholderAR 63. When preparing the information on carbon credits  required under paragraphs 56 (b) and 59, newlineplaceholderthe undertaking shall:  newlineplaceholder(a) Consider recognised quality standards; .  newlineplaceholder(b) if applicable, explain the role of carbon credits in its climate change mitigation  policy ;  newlineplaceholder(c) not include carbon credits issued from GHG emission reduction projects within its newlineplaceholdervalue chain as the respective GHG emission reductions shall already be disclosed newlineplaceholderunder Disclosure Requirement E1 -6 (Scope 2 or Scope 3) at the time they occur (i.e., newlineplaceholderdouble counting is avoided);  newlineplaceholder(d) not include carbon credi ts from GHG removal projects within its value chain as the newlineplaceholderrespective GHG removals may already be accounted for under Disclosure  newlineplaceholderRequirement E1 -7 at the time they occur (i.e., double counting is avoided);  newlineplaceholder(e) not disclose carbon credits as an offset for its GHG emissions under Disclosure newlineplaceholderRequirement E1 -6 on GHG emissions;  newlineplaceholder(f) not disclose carbon credits as a means to reach the GHG emission reduction targets newlineplaceholderdisclosed under Disclosure Requirement E1 -4; and  newlineplaceholder(g) calculate the amount of carbon credits to be cancelled i n the future, as the sum of carbon newlineplaceholdercredits in metric tonnes of CO 2eq over the duration of existing contractual agreements.  newlineplaceholderAR 64.

Material climate -related  physical risks  and transition risks  may affect the undertaking’s newlineplaceholderfinancial position (e.g., owned assets, financially -controlled leased assets, and liabilities), newlineplaceholderperformance (e.g., potential future increase/decrease in net revenue and costs due to newlineplaceholderbusiness  interruptions, increased supply prices resulting in potential margin erosions), and newlineplaceholdercash flows. The low probability, high severity and long -term time horizons of some climate - newlineplaceholderrelated physical risk exposures and the uncertainty arising from the transition  to a sustainable newlineplaceholdereconomy mean that there will be associated material anticipated financial effects  that are newlineplaceholderoutside the scope of the requirements of applicable accounting standards.  newlineplaceholderAR 68. Currently, there is no commonly accepted methodology to assess or  measure how material newlineplaceholderphysical risks  and transition risks  may affect the undertaking’s future financial position, newlineplaceholderfinancial, performance and cash flows. Therefore, the disclosure of the financial effects (as newlineplaceholderrequired by paragraphs 64, 66 and 67) will depen d on the undertaking’s internal methodology newlineplaceholderand the exercise of significant judgement in determining the inputs, and assumptions needed newlineplaceholderto quantify their anticipated financial effects.   newlineplaceholder  newlineplaceholderCalculation guidance - Anticipated financial effects from material physical risks  newlineplaceholderAR 69. When disclosing the information required under paragraphs 64 (a) and 66, the undertaking shall newlineplaceholderexplain whether and how:  newlineplaceholder(a) it assessed the anticipated financial effects  for assets and business activities at newlineplaceholdermaterial physical risk, including the scope of application, time horizons, calculation newlineplaceholdermethodology, critical assumptions and parameters and limitations of the assessment; newlineplaceholderand  newlineplaceholder(b) the assessment of assets and business act ivities considered to be at material physical newlineplaceholderrisk relies on or is part of the process to determine material physical risk as required newlineplaceholderunder paragraphs 20 (b) and AR 11 and to determine climate scenarios  as required newlineplaceholderunder paragraphs 19 and AR 13 to AR 14. In particular, it shall explain how it has newlineplaceholderdefined medium - and long -term time horizons and how these definitions are linked to newlineplaceholderthe expected lifetime of the undertaking’s assets, strategic planning horizons and newlineplaceholdercapital allocation plans.  newlineplaceholderAR 70. When prepari ng the information on assets at material physical risk that is required to be newlineplaceholderdisclosed under paragraph 66 (a), the undertaking shall:  newlineplaceholder(a) Calculate the assets at material physical risk in terms of monetary amount and as a newlineplaceholderproportion (percentage) of total ass ets at the reporting date (i.e., the proportion is an newlineplaceholderestimate of the carrying value of assets at material physical risk divided by total carrying newlineplaceholdervalue as stated in the statement of financial position or balance sheet). The estimate of  newlineplaceholder37  newlineplaceholder  assets at material physical risk shall be derived starting from the assets recognised in newlineplaceholderthe financial statements. The estimate of monetary amounts and proportion of assets newlineplaceholderat physical risk may be presented as either a single amount or range.  newlineplaceholder(b) All types of assets including f inance -lease / right -of-use assets shall be considered newlineplaceholderwhen determining the assets at material physical risk.  newlineplaceholder(c) To contextualise this information, the undertaking shall:  newlineplaceholderi. disclose the location of its significant assets at material physical risk.
