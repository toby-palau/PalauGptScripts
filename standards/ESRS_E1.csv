This can be done by the normalisation of the baseline value, or, by using a baseline value that is derived from a 3-year average if this increases the representativeness and allows a more faithful representation;"
AR25b,ESRS E1,3,Disclosure Requirements,E1-4,narrative,"the baseline value and base year shall not be changed unless significant changes in either the target or reporting boundary occur.

To foster comparability, when setting new targets, the undertaking shall select a recent base year that does not precede the first reporting year of the new target period by longer than 3 years. For example, for 2030 as the target year and a target period between 2025 and 2030, the base year shall be selected from the period between 2022 and 2025;"

For this purpose, the undertaking shall calculate a 1.5°C aligned reference target value for Scope 1 and 2 (and, if applicable, a separate one for Scope 3) against which its own GHG emission reduction targets or interim targets in the respective Scopes can be compared."
AR27,ESRS E1,3,Disclosure Requirements,E1-4,,The reference target value may be calculated by multiplying the GHG emissions in the base year with either a sector-specific (sectoral decarbonisation methodology) or cross-sector (contraction methodology) emission reduction factor. These emission reduction factors can be derived from different sources. The undertaking should ensure that the source used is based on an emission reduction pathway compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5°C.
AR28,ESRS E1,3,Disclosure Requirements,E1-4,,"The emission reduction factors are subject to further development. Consequently, undertakings are encouraged to only use updated publicly available information."
AR29,ESRS E1,3,Disclosure Requirements,E1-4,,"The reference target value is dependent on the base year and baseline emissions of the undertaking’s GHG emission reduction target. As a result, the reference target value for undertakings with a recent base year or from higher baseline emissions may be less challenging to achieve than it will be for undertakings that have already taken ambitious past actions to reduce GHG emissions. Therefore, undertakings that have in the past achieved GHG emissions reductions compatible with either a 1.5°C-aligned cross-sector or sector specific pathway, may adjust their baseline emissions accordingly to determine the reference target value. Accordingly, if the undertaking is adjusting the baseline emissions to determine the reference target value, it shall not consider GHG emission reductions that precede the year 2020 and it shall provide appropriate evidence of its past achieved GHG emission reduction."
